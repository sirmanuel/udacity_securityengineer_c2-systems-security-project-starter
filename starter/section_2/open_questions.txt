Questions for "Threat Mitigation"

Criteria:
Apply security best practices to secure remote login services on the system.
Task: Once the configuration change has been made, change your root password to further ensure that the attackers won't be able to use sudo to elevate their privilege to root.
Question:
How can I change my root passwort?
I changed it via command "sudo passwd root". 
To change the user to root via command "su root" I have to enter the new password.
Was that all? I am a bit confused.
If I execte a command with the "sudo" I have to use the password of the current user "ubuntu".
E.g. "sudo mkdir test" creates a folder with rights for the user "root" and group "root".
I don't know what to do for the instruction: Once the configuration change has been made, change your root password to further ensure that the attackers won't be able to use sudo to elevate their privilege to root.

General Questions:
How can I find out how the backdoor process (remotesec) starts automatically after restarting the computer?
How to search for the start command that is automatically executed on a reboot?

The Process remotesec  is not listed at the running services (command line: service --status-all)
